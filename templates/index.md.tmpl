# PingOne Provider

The PingOne provider interacts with the configuration of the PingOne platform via the management API. The provider requires credentials from worker application client before it can be used.

## Getting Started

To get started using the PingOne Terraform provider, first you'll need an active PingOne cloud subscription.  Get instant access with a [PingOne trial account](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/try-ping.html), or read more about Ping Identity at [pingidentity.com](https://www.pingidentity.com)

### Configure PingOne for Terraform access

For detailed instructions on how to prepare PingOne for Terraform access, see the [PingOne getting started guide](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/getting-started/pingone/#configure-pingone-for-terraform-access) at [terraform.pingidentity.com](https://terraform.pingidentity.com).

### Ping Identity Developer Experiences

For code examples showing how to configure the PingOne service using Terraform, the following resources are available:

- [Tutorials and use-case examples](https://terraform.pingidentity.com/examples/) at [terraform.pingidentity.com](https://terraform.pingidentity.com).
- End-to-end solution deployment examples, complete with sample applications at the [Ping Identity Developers Experience Github](https://github.com/pingidentity-developers-experience?tab=repositories).

## Example Usage

### Authenticate using static worker client credentials

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

### Authenticate using environment variable worker client credentials

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-env.tf" }}

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s" "examples/provider/provider-env.sh") }}

### Authenticate using an environment variable access token

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider-env.tf" }}

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s" "examples/provider/provider-env-at.sh") }}

### Custom User Agent information

The PingOne provider allows custom information to be appended to the default user agent string (that includes Terraform provider version information) by setting the `PINGONE_TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable.  This can be useful when troubleshooting issues with Ping Identity Support, or adding context to HTTP requests.

## Schema

### Required

- `region` (String) The PingOne region to use.  Options are `AsiaPacific`, `Canada`, `Europe` and `NorthAmerica`.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_REGION` environment variable.
- `api_access_token` (String) The access token used for provider resource management against the PingOne management API.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.  Must provide only one of `api_access_token` (when obtaining the worker token outside of the provider) and `client_id` (when the provider should fetch the worker token during operations).
- `client_id` (String) Client ID for the worker app client.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.  Must provide only one of `api_access_token` (when obtaining the worker token outside of the provider) and `client_id` (when the provider should fetch the worker token during operations).  Must be configured with `client_secret` and `environment_id`.
- `client_secret` (String) Client secret for the worker app client.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.  Must be configured with `client_id` and `environment_id`.
- `environment_id` (String) Environment ID for the worker app client.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` environment variable.  Must be configured with `client_id` and `client_secret`.

### Optional

- `force_delete_production_type` (Boolean) Choose whether to force-delete any configuration that has a `PRODUCTION` type parameter.  The platform default is that `PRODUCTION` type configuration will not destroy without intervention to protect stored data.  By default this parameter is set to `false` and can be overridden with the `PINGONE_FORCE_DELETE_PRODUCTION_TYPE` environment variable.
- `service_endpoints` (Block List) A single block containing configuration items to override the service API endpoints of PingOne. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--service_endpoints))

<a id="nestedblock--service_endpoints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `service_endpoints`

Required:

- `api_hostname` (String) Hostname for the PingOne management service API, for example, `api.pingone.eu`.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_API_SERVICE_HOSTNAME` environment variable.
- `auth_hostname` (String) Hostname for the PingOne authentication service API, for example, `auth.pingone.eu`.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_AUTH_SERVICE_HOSTNAME` environment variable.
