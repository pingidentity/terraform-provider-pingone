{{ .Description | trimspace }}

~> PingOne environments are created with a default population and at least one service added.  Default populations can be managed with the `pingone_population_default` resource.

~> This `pingone_environment` resource does not yet support creation of WORKFORCE enabled environments.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/resource.tf") }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax examples, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "%s%s%s" "examples/resources/" .Name "/import.sh") }}
