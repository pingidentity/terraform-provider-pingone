// UnmodifiableDataLossProtection creates a plan modifier that prevents changes to protect against data loss.
// It returns a plan modifier that prevents any modifications to a string attribute once it has been set,
// requiring manual resource replacement to change the value. This is used for critical attributes where
// modification could result in data loss and requires explicit user action.
//
// The plan modifier will generate an error for any attempted changes, directing users to use
// Terraform's replace command option to manually replace the resource when changes are needed.
