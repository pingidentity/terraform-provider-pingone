# Contributing to the PingOne Terraform Provider

We appreciate your help!  We welcome contributions in the form of creating issues or pull requests.

Know that:

1. If you have any questions, please ask!  We'll help as best we can
2. While we appreciate perfect PRs, it's not essential. We'll fix up any housekeeping changes before merge.  Any PRs that need further work, we'll point you in the right direction or can take on ourselves.
3. We may not be able to respond quickly, our development cycles are on a priority basis.
4. We base our priorities on customer need and the number of votes on issues/PRs by the number of üëç reactions.  If there is an existing issue or PR for something you'd like, please vote!
5. Some files are created and maintained by an internal generator project. These files are marked with comments at the top of the file. We may not be able to merge changes to these files as changes will be overwritten by the generator.

The following guides are there to help you get started with provider development, logging issues and creating PRs.  Following the guides allows us to respond quicker and will result in faster PR merges.
