## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the gateway credential in.
- `gateway_id` (String) The ID of the gateway to associate the credential with.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) A date that specifies the date the credential was created in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
- `credential` (String, Sensitive) A string that specifies the signed JWT for the gateway credential.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `last_used_at` (String) A date that specifies the date the credential was last used in UTC.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_gateway_credential.example <environment_id>/<gateway_id>/<gateway_credential_id>
```

~> The `credential` attribute is not available on import.  The gateway credential is only available on resource creation.
