# pingone_authorize_trust_framework_condition (Resource)

Resource to create and manage an authorization condition for the PingOne Authorize Trust Framework in a PingOne environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_authorize_trust_framework_condition" "my_awesome_condition" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "Compare Values"
  description    = "My awesome compound condition."

  condition = {
    type = "OR"

    conditions = [
      {
        type       = "COMPARISON"
        comparator = "EQUALS"

        left = {
          type = "ATTRIBUTE"
          id   = pingone_authorize_trust_framework_attribute.my_awesome_attribute.id
        }

        right = {
          type  = "CONSTANT"
          value = "my_awesome_value"
        }
      },
      {
        type = "NOT"

        condition = {
          type       = "COMPARISON"
          comparator = "EQUALS"

          left = {
            type  = "ATTRIBUTE"
            value = pingone_authorize_trust_framework_attribute.my_awesome_attribute.id
          }

          right = {
            type  = "CONSTANT"
            value = "my_not_so_awesome_value"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `condition` (Attributes) An object that specifies configuration settings for the authorization condition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--condition))
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to configure the Authorize editor condition in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `name` (String) A string that specifies a user-friendly name to apply to the authorization condition.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A string that specifies a description to apply to the authorization condition.
- `full_name` (String) A string that specifies a unique name generated by the system for each authorization condition resource. It is the concatenation of names in the condition resource hierarchy.
- `parent` (Attributes) An object that specifies configuration settings for the condition resource's parent. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--parent))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `type` (String) A string that describes the type of the resource.
- `version` (String) A string that specifies a random ID generated by the system for concurrency control purposes.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_authorize_editor_condition.example <environment_id>/<editor_condition_id>
```
