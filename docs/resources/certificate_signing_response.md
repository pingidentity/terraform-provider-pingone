# pingone_certificate_signing_response (Resource)

Resource to import a CA issued response to a downloaded certificate signing request (CSR).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_certificate_signing_response" "my_signed_response" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  key_id               = pingone_key.my_key.id
  pem_ca_response_file = var.pem_ca_response_file
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment that contains the key to which the CSR corresponds.
- `key_id` (String) The system name of the key.
- `pem_ca_response_file` (String) A PEM encoded file that has been provided by the signing authority in response to the key's CSR.

### Read-Only

- `algorithm` (String) Specifies the key algorithm. Options are `RSA`, `EC`, and `UNKNOWN`.
- `default` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether this is the default key for the specified environment.
- `expires_at` (String) The time the key resource expires.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `issuer_dn` (String) A string that specifies the distinguished name of the certificate issuer.
- `key_length` (Number) An integer that specifies the key length. For RSA keys, options are `2048`, `3072`, `4096` and `7680`. For elliptical curve (EC) keys, options are `224`, `256`, `384` and `521`.
- `name` (String) The system name of the key.
- `serial_number` (String) An integer (in string data type) that specifies the serial number of the key or certificate.
- `signature_algorithm` (String) Specifies the signature algorithm of the key. For RSA keys, options are `SHA224withRSA`, `SHA256withRSA`, `SHA384withRSA` and `SHA512withRSA`. For elliptical curve (EC) keys, options are `SHA224withECDSA`, `SHA256withECDSA`, `SHA384withECDSA` and `SHA512withECDSA`.
- `starts_at` (String) The time the validity period starts.
- `status` (String) A string that specifies the status of the key. Options are `VALID`, `EXPIRING`, `EXPIRED`, `NOT_YET_VALID`, and `REVOKED`.
- `subject_dn` (String) A string that specifies the distinguished name of the subject being secured.
- `usage_type` (String) A string that specifies how the certificate is used. Options are `ENCRYPTION`, `SIGNING`, `SSL/TLS` and `ISSUANCE`.
- `validity_period` (Number) An integer that specifies the number of days the key is valid.
