## Example Usage

```terraform

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `components` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the form configuration elements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--components))
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to manage the form in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `mark_optional` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether optional fields are highlighted in the rendered form.
- `mark_required` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether required fields are highlighted in the rendered form.
- `name` (String) A string that specifies the form name, which must be provided and must be unique within an environment.

### Optional

- `category` (String) A string that specifies the type of form.  Options are `CUSTOM` (allows the form to be built with fields that do not map specifically to the PingOne directory attributes).  Defaults to `CUSTOM`.
- `cols` (String) An integer that specifies the number of columns in the form (min = `1`; max = `4`).  Defaults to `UNKNOWN`.
- `description` (String) A string that specifies the description of the form.
- `language_bundle` (Map of String) An map of strings that provides i18n keys to their translations. This object includes both the keys and their default translations. The PingOne language management service finds this object, and creates the new keys for translation for this form.
- `translation_method` (String) A string that specifies how to translate the text strings in the form.  Options are `DEFAULT_VALUE`, `KEY`, `TRANSLATE`.  Defaults to `UNKNOWN`.

### Read-Only

- `field_types` (Set of String) A set of strings that specifies the field types in the form.  Options are `CHECKBOX`, `COMBOBOX`, `DIVIDER`, `DROPDOWN`, `EMPTY_FIELD`, `ERROR_DISPLAY`, `FLOW_BUTTON`, `FLOW_LINK`, `PASSWORD`, `PASSWORD_VERIFY`, `QR_CODE`, `RADIO`, `RECAPTCHA_V2`, `SLATE_TEXTBLOB`, `SOCIAL_LOGIN_BUTTON`, `SUBMIT_BUTTON`, `TEXT`, `TEXTBLOB`.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--components"></a>
### Nested Schema for `components`

Required:

- `fields` (Attributes Set) A set of objects that specifies the form fields that make up the form. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--components--fields))

<a id="nestedatt--components--fields"></a>
### Nested Schema for `components.fields`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_form.example <environment_id>/<form_id>
```
