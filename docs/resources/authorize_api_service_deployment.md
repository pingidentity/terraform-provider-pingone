# pingone_authorize_api_service_deployment (Resource)

Resource to manage the deployment of an API Service for PingOne Authorize in an environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_resource" "my_resource" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name = "My awesome custom resource"

  audience                      = "https://api.bxretail.org"
  access_token_validity_seconds = 3600
}

resource "pingone_authorize_api_service" "my_awesome_api_service" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name = "My awesome API service"

  base_urls = [
    "https://api.bxretail.org",
    "https://api.bxretail.org/path"
  ]

  authorization_server = {
    resource_id = pingone_resource.my_resource.id
    type        = "PINGONE_SSO"
  }
}

resource "pingone_authorize_api_service_operation" "my_awesome_api_service_operation" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  api_service_id = pingone_authorize_api_service.my_awesome_api_service.id

  name = "My awesome API service operation"

  methods = [
    "POST",
    "PUT",
    "GET",
    "DELETE",
  ]

  paths = [
    {
      pattern = "/awesome/1"
      type    = "EXACT"
    },
    {
      pattern = "/awesome/{variable}/*"
      type    = "PARAMETER"
    },
  ]
}

variable "redeploy_trigger_date" {
  type = string
}

resource "pingone_authorize_api_service_deployment" "my_awesome_api_service" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  api_service_id = pingone_authorize_api_service.my_awesome_api_service.id

  redeployment_trigger_values = {
    "redeploy" : var.redeploy_trigger_date
  }

  depends_on = [

## Schema

### Required

- `api_service_id` (String) The ID of the API service to deploy.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to deploy the API Service in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Optional

- `redeployment_trigger_values` (Map of String) A meta-argument map of values that, if any values are changed, will force redeployment.  Adding values to and removing values from the map will not trigger a deployment.

### Read-Only

- `authorization_version` (Attributes) A single object that describes properties related to the authorization version that relates to the API service that has been deployed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--authorization_version))
- `decision_endpoint` (Attributes) A single object that describes properties related to the decision endpoint that relates to the API service that has been deployed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--decision_endpoint))
- `deployed_at` (String) An RFC3339 compliant date/time string that specifies the time of the most recent successful deployment. The field will be null if the API service has never been successfully deployed.
- `policy` (Attributes) A single object that describes properties related to the root policy that relates to the API service that has been deployed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--policy))
- `status` (Attributes) A single object that describes properties related to the status of the API service deployment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))

<a id="nestedatt--authorization_version"></a>
### Nested Schema for `authorization_version`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) A string that specifies the UUID of the last deployed policy authorization version. This is present only if custom polcies are enabled and the API service has been deployed at least once.


<a id="nestedatt--decision_endpoint"></a>
### Nested Schema for `decision_endpoint`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) A string that specifies the UUID of the decision endpoint.


<a id="nestedatt--policy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `policy`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) A string that specifies the UUID of the root policy.


<a id="nestedatt--status"></a>
### Nested Schema for `status`

Read-Only:

- `code` (String) A string that describes the deployment status code. For possible values, see [Deployment status codes](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#service-deployment-status-codes).
- `error` (Attributes) A single object that describes properties related to an error status of the API service deployment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status--error))

<a id="nestedatt--status--error"></a>
### Nested Schema for `status.error`

Read-Only:

- `code` (String) A string that describes a general fault code that identifies the the type of error. See [Error codes](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#error-codes).
- `id` (String) A string that specifies the UUID of the root policy.
- `message` (String) A string that describes a short, human-readable description of the error.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_authorize_api_service_deployment.example <environment_id>/<api_service_id>
```
