# pingone_population (Resource)

Resource to create and manage a PingOne population in an environment.

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_population" "my_population" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name        = "My awesome population"
  description = "My new population for awesome people"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the population in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `name` (String) A string that specifies the name of the population.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A string that specifies a description to apply to the population.
- `password_policy_id` (String) A string that specifies the ID of a password policy to assign to the population.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_population.example <environment_id>/<population_id>
```
