## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) A string that specifies the user's email address, which must be provided and valid. For more information about email address formatting, see section 3.4 of [RFC 2822, Internet Message Format](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html).
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the user in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `population_id` (String) The identifier of the population resource associated with the user.
- `username` (String) A string that specifies the user name, which must be provided and must be unique within an environment. The `username` must either be a well-formed email address or a string. The string can contain any letters, numbers, combining characters, math and currency symbols, dingbats and drawing characters, and invisible whitespace

### Optional

- `external_id` (String) A string that specifies an identifier for the user resource as defined by the provisioning client. This may be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. The externalId attribute simplifies the correlation of the user in PingOne with the userâ€™s account in another system of record.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_user.example <environment_id>/<user_id>
```
