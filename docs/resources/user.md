# pingone_user (Resource)

Resource to create and manage a PingOne user in an environment.

!> This resource is designed to support the creation of non-human users for testing and demo purposes, and is not designed for user migration activities.  Bulk user migration can be performed using the [PingOne User Import Tool](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingone-user-import-tool).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_population" "my_population" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name = "My population of awesome identities"

  lifecycle {
    # change the `prevent_destroy` parameter value to `true` to prevent this data carrying resource from being destroyed
    prevent_destroy = false
  }
}

resource "pingone_user" "foo" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  population_id = pingone_population.my_population.id

  username = "foouser"
  email    = "foouser@pingidentity.com"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) A string that specifies the user's email address, which must be provided and valid. For more information about email address formatting, see section 3.4 of [RFC 2822, Internet Message Format](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html).
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to manage the user in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `population_id` (String) The identifier of the population resource associated with the user.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.
- `username` (String) A string that specifies the user name, which must be provided and must be unique within an environment. The `username` must either be a well-formed email address or a string. The string can contain any letters, numbers, combining characters, math and currency symbols, dingbats and drawing characters, and invisible whitespace

### Optional

- `account` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's account information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account))
- `address` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's address information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--address))
- `enabled` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the user is enabled. This attribute is set to `true` by default when the user is created.
- `external_id` (String) A string that specifies an identifier for the user resource as defined by the provisioning client. This may be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. The external id attribute simplifies the correlation of the user in PingOne with the user's account in another system of record. The platform does not use this attribute directly in any way, but it is used by Ping Identity's Data Sync product. It can have a length of no more than 1024 characters.
- `identity_provider` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's identity provider information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--identity_provider))
- `locale` (String) A string that specifies the user's default location. This may be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. This is used for purposes of localizing such items as currency, date time format, or numerical representations. If provided, it must be a valid language tag as defined in [RFC 5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html). The following are example tags: `fr`, `en-US`, `es-419`, `az-Arab`, `man-Nkoo-GN`. The string can contain any letters, numbers, combining characters, math and currency symbols, dingbats and drawing characters, and invisible whitespace. It can have a length of no more than 256 characters.
- `mfa_enabled` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether multi-factor authentication is enabled.  Defaults to `false`.
- `mobile_phone` (String) A string that specifies the user's native phone number. This might also match the `primary_phone` attribute. This may be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. Valid phone numbers must have at least one number and a maximum character length of 32.
- `name` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's name information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--name))
- `nickname` (String) A string that specifies the user's nickname. This can be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. The string can contain any letters, numbers, combining characters, math and currency symbols, dingbats and drawing characters, and invisible whitespace. It can have a length of no more than 256 characters.
- `password` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's password information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--password))
- `photo` (Attributes) A single object that describes the user's photo information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--photo))
- `preferred_language` (String) A string that specifies the user's preferred written or spoken languages. This may be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it.

For example: `en-US`, `en-gb;q=0.8`, `en;q=0.7`.
- `primary_phone` (String) A string that specifies the user's primary phone number. This might also match the `mobile_phone` attribute. This may be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. Valid phone numbers must have at least one number and a maximum character length of 32.

If provided, it must conform with the IANA Time Zone database format [RFC 6557](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6557.html), also known as the "Olson" time zone database format [Olson-TZ](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) for example, `America/Los_Angeles`.
- `title` (String) A string that specifies the user's title, such as `Vice President`. This can be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. The string can contain any letters, numbers, combining characters, math and currency symbols, dingbats and drawing characters, and invisible whitespace. It can have a length of no more than 256 characters.
- `type` (String) A string that specifies the user's type, which is optional. This can be explicitly set to null when updating a user to unset it. This attribute is organization-specific and has no special meaning within the PingOne platform. It is a free-text field that could have values of (for example) `Contractor`, `Employee`, `Intern`, `Temp`, `External`, and `Unknown`. The string can contain any letters, numbers, combining characters, math and currency symbols, dingbats and drawing characters, and invisible whitespace. It can have a length of no more than 256 characters.
- `user_lifecycle` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's identity lifecycle information.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--user_lifecycle))
- `verify_status` (String) A string that indicates whether ID verification can be done for the user.  Options are `DISABLED`, `ENABLED`, `NOT_INITIATED`.  If the user verification status is `DISABLED`, a new verification status cannot be created for that user until the status is changed to `ENABLED`.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_user.example <environment_id>/<user_id>
```
