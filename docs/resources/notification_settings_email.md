# pingone_notification_settings_email (Resource)

Resource to manage the email sender settings in a PingOne environment.

~> Only one `pingone_notification_settings_email` resource should be configured for an environment.  If multiple `pingone_notification_settings_email` resource definitions exist in HCL code, these are likely to conflict with each other on apply.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_notification_settings_email" "my_awesome_smtp_settings" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  host     = "smtp-example.bxretail.org"
  port     = 25
  username = var.smtp_server_username
  password = var.smtp_server_password

  from = {
    email_address = "services@bxretail.org"
    name          = "Customer Services"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to configure email settings in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `from` (Attributes) A required single block that specifies the email sender's "from" name and email address. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--from))
- `host` (String) A string that specifies the organization's SMTP server.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) A string that specifies the organization's SMTP server's password.
- `port` (Number) An integer that specifies the port used by the organization's SMTP server to send emails (default: `465`). Note that the protocol used depends upon the port specified. If you specify port `25`, `587`, or `2525`, SMTP with `STARTTLS` is used. Otherwise, `SMTPS` is used.
- `username` (String) A string that specifies the organization's SMTP server's username.

### Optional

```
