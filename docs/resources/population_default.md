# pingone_population_default (Resource)

Resource to overwrite the default PingOne population, or create it if it doesn't already exist.

~> When destroying the resource, the default population will be reset to it's original configuration, and then removed from Terraform's state.  The population itself (and any user data contained in the population) will not be removed from the PingOne service.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_population_default" "my_default_population" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name        = "My default population"
  description = "A resource that overwrites the default population"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to manage the default population in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `name` (String) The name to apply to the default population.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description to apply to the default population.
- `password_policy_id` (String) The ID of a password policy to assign to the default population.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_population_default.example <environment_id>
```
