# pingone_environment (Resource)

Resource to create and manage PingOne environments.

~> PingOne environments are created with a default population and at least one service added.  Default populations can be managed with the `pingone_population_default` resource.

~> This `pingone_environment` resource does not yet support creation of WORKFORCE enabled environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  name        = "New Environment"
  description = "My new environment"
  type        = "SANDBOX"
  license_id  = var.license_id

  services = [
    {
      type = "SSO"
    },
    {
      type = "DaVinci"
      tags = ["DAVINCI_MINIMAL"]
    },
    {
      type = "MFA"
    },
    {
      type        = "PingFederate"
      console_url = "https://my-pingfederate-console.example.com/pingfederate"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `license_id` (String) A string that specifies the ID of a valid license to apply to the environment.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.
- `name` (String) A string that specifies the name of the environment.
- `services` (Attributes Set) A set of objects that specify the services to enable in the environment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--services))

### Optional

- `description` (String) A string that specifies the description to apply to the environment.
- `region` (String) A string that specifies the region to create the environment in.  Should be consistent with the PingOne organisation region.  Options are `AP`, `AU`, `CA`, `EU`, `NA`.  Will default to the region specified in the provider configuration if not specified, or can be set with the `PINGONE_REGION_CODE` environment variable.
- `solution` (String) A string that specifies the solution context of the environment.  Leave undefined for a custom, non-workforce solution context.  Options are `CIAM_TRIAL`, `CUSTOMER`.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `type` (String) A string that specifies the type of the environment to create.  Options are `PRODUCTION` (for environments that require protection from deletion), `SANDBOX` (for a development/testing environment).  Once an environment has been set as `PRODUCTION` type, it cannot be reset back to `SANDBOX` within Terraform.  Administrators must log in to the web admin console to override the data protection features of `PRODUCTION` environments.  Defaults to `SANDBOX`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `organization_id` (String) A string that represents the ID of the PingOne organization tenant to which the environment belongs.

### Nested Schema for `services`

Required:

- `type` (String) A string that specifies the service type to enable in the environment.  Options are `APIIntelligence`, `Authorize`, `Credentials`, `DaVinci`, `MFA`, `PingAccess`, `PingAuthorize`, `PingCentral`, `PingDirectory`, `PingFederate`, `PingID`, `Risk`, `SSO`, `Verify`.

Optional:

- `bookmarks` (Attributes Set) A set of objects that specify custom bookmark links for the service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--services--bookmarks))
- `console_url` (String) A string that specifies the custom console URL to set.  Generally used with services that are deployed separately to the PingOne SaaS service, such as `PingFederate`, `PingAccess`, `PingDirectory`, `PingAuthorize` and `PingCentral`.
- `tags` (Set of String) A set of string tags to apply upon environment creation.  Only configurable when the service `type` is `DaVinci`.  Options are `DAVINCI_MINIMAL` (allows for a creation of an environment without example/demo configuration in the DaVinci service).  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

<a id="nestedatt--services--bookmarks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `services.bookmarks`

Required:

- `name` (String) A string that specifies the bookmark name.
- `url` (String) A string that represents the bookmark URL.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax examples, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_environment.example <environment_id>
```
