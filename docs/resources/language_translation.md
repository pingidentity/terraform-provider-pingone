## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create and manage the language_translation in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `key` (String) The page and name of the interface element to be localized (for example, `flow-ui.button.cancel`).
- `locale` (String) An ISO standard language code. For more information about standard language codes, see [ISO Language Code Table](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).  The following language codes are reserved as they are created automatically in the environment: `cs`, `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `fr-CA`, `hu`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt`, `ru`, `th`, `tr`, `zh`.
- `translated_text` (String) The translated string text associated with the interface element.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `reference_text` (String) The English string text associated with the interface element.
- `short_key` (String) The interface element only (for example, `button.cancel`).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_language_translation.example <environment_id>/<locale_id>/<translation_id>
```
