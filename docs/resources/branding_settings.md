## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to set branding settings for.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Optional

- `company_name` (String) The company name associated with the specified environment.
- `logo_image` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the HREF and ID for the company logo. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--logo_image))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--logo_image"></a>
### Nested Schema for `logo_image`

Required:

- `href` (String) The URL or fully qualified path to the logo file used for branding.  This can be retrieved from the `uploaded_image.href` parameter of the `pingone_image` resource.
- `id` (String) The ID of the logo image.  This can be retrieved from the `id` parameter of the `pingone_image` resource.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_branding_settings.example <environment_id>
```
