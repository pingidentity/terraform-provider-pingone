# pingone_mfa_device_policy (Resource)

Resource to create and manage MFA device policies for a PingOne environment.

## Example Usage - Basic Policy

The following example enables the FIDO2 and TOTP Authenticator factors. 

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_mfa_device_policy" "my_awesome_mfa_device_policy" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "My awesome MFA device policy"

  mobile = {
    enabled = false
  }

  totp = {
    enabled = true
  }

  fido2 = {

  }

  sms = {

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_mfa_device_policy.example <environment_id>/<mfa_device_policy_id>
```
