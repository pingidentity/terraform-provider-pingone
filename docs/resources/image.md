# pingone_image (Resource)

Resource to create and manage PingOne images in an environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_image" "foo" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  image_file_base64 = filebase64("../path/to/image.jpg")
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the image in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `image_file_base64` (String) A base64 encoded image file to import.  Only PNG, GIF and JPG images are supported.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `uploaded_image` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the processed image details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--uploaded_image))

<a id="nestedatt--uploaded_image"></a>
### Nested Schema for `uploaded_image`

Read-Only:

- `height` (Number) The height of the image (in pixels).
- `href` (String) A string that specifies the URL or fully qualified path to the image source file.
- `type` (String) A string that specifies the type of format used for the image. Options are `jpg`, `png`, and `gif`.
- `width` (Number) The width of the image (in pixels).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_image.example <environment_id>/<image_id>
```
