# pingone_authorize_policy_management_policy (Resource)

Resource to create and manage an authorization policy for the PingOne Authorize Policy Manager in a PingOne environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_authorize_policy_management_policy" "my_awesome_policy" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  # ...
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `combining_algorithm` (Attributes) An object that specifies configuration settings that determine how rules are combined to produce an authorization decision. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--combining_algorithm))
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to configure the Authorize editor policy in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `name` (String) A string that specifies a user-friendly name to apply to the authorization policy.  The value must be unique.

### Optional

- `children` (Attributes List) An ordered list of objects that specifies child policies or policy sets. Policies can either be specified by reference using the `value` field, or by inline definition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--children))
- `condition` (Attributes) An object that specifies configuration settings for an authorization condition to apply to the policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--condition))
- `description` (String) A string that specifies a description to apply to the policy.
- `enabled` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the policy is enabled, and whether the policy is evaluated.  Defaults to `true`.
- `repetition_settings` (Attributes) An object that specifies configuration settings that appies the policy to each item of the specific attribute, filtered by decision. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--repetition_settings))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `version` (String) A string that specifies a random ID generated by the system for concurrency control purposes.

```
