- `initiate_login_uri` (String) A string that specifies the URI to use for third-parties to begin the sign-on process for the application. If specified, PingOne redirects users to this URI to initiate SSO to PingOne. The application is responsible for implementing the relevant OIDC flow when the initiate login URI is requested. This property is required if you want the application to appear in the PingOne Application Portal. See the OIDC specification section of [Initiating Login from a Third Party](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ThirdPartyInitiatedLogin) for more information.  The provided URL is expected to use the `https://` schema.  The `http` schema is permitted where the host is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
- `jwks` (String) A string that specifies a JWKS string that validates the signature of signed JWTs for applications that use the `PRIVATE_KEY_JWT` option for the `token_endpoint_auth_method`. This property is required when `token_endpoint_auth_method` is `PRIVATE_KEY_JWT` and the `jwks_url` property is empty. For more information, see [Create a private_key_jwt JWKS string](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#create-a-private_key_jwt-jwks-string). This property is also required if the optional `request` property JWT on the authorize endpoint is signed using the RS256 (or RS384, RS512) signing algorithm and the `jwks_url` property is empty. For more infornmation about signing the `request` property JWT, see [Create a request property JWT](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#create-a-request-property-jwt).  Conflicts with `jwks_url`.
- `jwks_url` (String) A string that specifies a URL (supports `https://` only) that provides access to a JWKS string that validates the signature of signed JWTs for applications that use the `PRIVATE_KEY_JWT` option for the `token_endpoint_auth_method`. This property is required when `token_endpoint_auth_method` is `PRIVATE_KEY_JWT` and the `jwks` property is empty. For more information, see [Create a private_key_jwt JWKS string](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#create-a-private_key_jwt-jwks-string). This property is also required if the optional `request` property JWT on the authorize endpoint is signed using the RS256 (or RS384, RS512) signing algorithm and the `jwks` property is empty. For more infornmation about signing the `request` property JWT, see [Create a request property JWT](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#create-a-request-property-jwt).  Conflicts with `jwks`.

- `post_logout_redirect_uris` (Set of String) A list of strings that specifies the URLs that the browser can be redirected to after logout.  The provided URLs are expected to use the `https://`, `http://` schema, or a custom mobile native schema (e.g., `org.bxretail.app://logout`).
- `redirect_uris` (Set of String) A list of strings that specifies the allowed callback URIs for the authentication response.    The provided URLs are expected to use the `https://` schema, or a custom mobile native schema (e.g., `org.bxretail.app://callback`).  The `http` schema is only permitted where the host is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

If the `refresh_token_rolling_duration` property is specified for the application, then this property value must be less than or equal to the value of `refresh_token_rolling_duration`. After this property is set, the value cannot be nullified - this will reset the value back to the default. This value is used to generate the value for the exp claim when minting a new refresh token.  Defaults to `2592000`.
- `refresh_token_rolling_duration` (Number) An integer that specifies the number of seconds a refresh token can be exchanged before re-authentication is required. Valid values are between `60` and `2147483647`. After this property is set, the value cannot be nullified - this will force recreation of the resource. This value is used to generate the value for the exp claim when minting a new refresh token.  Defaults to `15552000`.
- `refresh_token_rolling_grace_period_duration` (Number) The number of seconds that a refresh token may be reused after having been exchanged for a new set of tokens. This is useful in the case of network errors on the client. Valid values are between `0` and `86400` seconds. `Null` is treated the same as `0`.
- `require_signed_request_object` (Boolean) A boolean that indicates that the Java Web Token (JWT) for the [request query](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RequestObject) parameter is required to be signed. If `false` or null, a signed request object is not required. Both `support_unsigned_request_object` and this property cannot be set to `true`.  Defaults to `false`.
- `response_types` (Set of String) A list that specifies the code or token type returned by an authorization request.  Options are `CODE`, `ID_TOKEN`, `TOKEN`.  Note that `CODE` cannot be used in an authorization request with `TOKEN` or `ID_TOKEN` because PingOne does not currently support OIDC hybrid flows.
- `support_unsigned_request_object` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the request query parameter JWT is allowed to be unsigned. If `false` or null, an unsigned request object is not allowed.  Defaults to `false`.
- `target_link_uri` (String) The URI for the application. If specified, PingOne will redirect application users to this URI after a user is authenticated. In the PingOne admin console, this becomes the value of the `target_link_uri` parameter used for the Initiate Single Sign-On URL field.  Both `http://` and `https://` URLs are permitted as well as custom mobile native schema (e.g., `org.bxretail.app://target`).

Optional:

- `decryption_key` (String, Sensitive) Play Integrity verdict decryption key from your Google Play Services account. This parameter must be provided if you have set `verification_type` to `INTERNAL`.  Conflicts with `service_account_credentials_json`.
- `service_account_credentials_json` (String, Sensitive) Contents of the JSON file that represents your Service Account Credentials. This parameter must be provided if you have set `verification_type` to `GOOGLE`.  Conflicts with `decryption_key`, `verification_key`.
- `verification_key` (String, Sensitive) Play Integrity verdict signature verification key from your Google Play Services account. This parameter must be provided if you have set `verification_type` to `INTERNAL`.  Conflicts with `service_account_credentials_json`.





<a id="nestedatt--saml_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `saml_options`

Required:

- `acs_urls` (Set of String) A list of string that specifies the Assertion Consumer Service URLs. The first URL in the list is used as default (there must be at least one URL).
- `assertion_duration` (Number) An integer that specifies the assertion validity duration in seconds.
- `idp_signing_key` (Attributes) SAML application assertion/response signing key settings.  Use with `assertion_signed_enabled` to enable assertion signing and/or `response_is_signed` to enable response signing.  It's highly recommended, and best practice, to define signing key settings for the configured SAML application.  However if this property is omitted, the default signing certificate for the environment is used.  This parameter will become a required field in the next major release of the provider. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--saml_options--idp_signing_key))
- `sp_entity_id` (String) A string that specifies the service provider entity ID used to lookup the application. This is a required property and is unique within the environment.

Optional:

- `assertion_signed_enabled` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the SAML assertion itself should be signed.  Defaults to `true`.
- `cors_settings` (Attributes) A single object that allows customization of how the Authorization and Authentication APIs interact with CORS requests that reference the application. If omitted, the application allows CORS requests from any origin except for operations that expose sensitive information (e.g. `/as/authorize` and `/as/token`).  This is legacy behavior, and it is recommended that applications migrate to include specific CORS settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--saml_options--cors_settings))
- `default_target_url` (String) A string that specfies a default URL used as the `RelayState` parameter by the IdP to deep link into the application after authentication. This value can be overridden by the `applicationUrl` query parameter for [GET Identity Provider Initiated SSO](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#get-identity-provider-initiated-sso). Although both of these parameters are generally URLs, because they are used as deep links, this is not enforced. If neither `defaultTargetUrl` nor `applicationUrl` is specified during a SAML authentication flow, no `RelayState` value is supplied to the application. The `defaultTargetUrl` (or the `applicationUrl`) value is passed to the SAML application’s ACS URL as a separate `RelayState` key value (not within the SAMLResponse key value).
- `enable_requested_authn_context` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether `requestedAuthnContext` is taken into account in policy decision-making.
- `home_page_url` (String) A string that specifies the custom home page URL for the application.
- `nameid_format` (String) A string that specifies the format of the Subject NameID attibute in the SAML assertion.
- `response_is_signed` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the SAML assertion response itself should be signed.  Defaults to `false`.
- `session_not_on_or_after_duration` (Number) An integer that specifies a value for if the SAML application requires a different `SessionNotOnOrAfter` attribute value within the `AuthnStatement` element than the `NotOnOrAfter` value set by the `assertion_duration` property.
- `slo_binding` (String) A string that specifies the binding protocol to be used for the logout response.  Options are `HTTP_POST`, `HTTP_REDIRECT`.  Existing configurations with no data default to `HTTP_POST`.  Defaults to `HTTP_POST`.
- `slo_endpoint` (String) A string that specifies the logout endpoint URL. This is an optional property. However, if a logout endpoint URL is not defined, logout actions result in an error.
- `slo_response_endpoint` (String) A string that specifies the endpoint URL to submit the logout response. If a value is not provided, the `slo_endpoint` property value is used to submit SLO response.
- `slo_window` (Number) An integer that defines how long (hours) PingOne can exchange logout messages with the application, specifically a logout request from the application, since the initial request.  The minimum value is `0` hour and the maximum is `24` hours.
- `sp_encryption` (Attributes) A single object that specifies settings for PingOne to encrypt SAML assertions to be sent to the application. Assertions are not encrypted by default. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--saml_options--sp_encryption))
- `sp_verification` (Attributes) A single object item that specifies SP signature verification settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--saml_options--sp_verification))
- `type` (String) A string that specifies the type associated with the application.  Options are `CUSTOM_APP`, `WEB_APP`.  Defaults to `WEB_APP`.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

<a id="nestedatt--saml_options--idp_signing_key"></a>
### Nested Schema for `saml_options.idp_signing_key`

Required:

- `algorithm` (String) Specifies the signature algorithm of the key. For RSA keys, options are `SHA256withRSA`, `SHA384withRSA` and `SHA512withRSA`. For elliptical curve (EC) keys, options are `SHA256withECDSA`, `SHA384withECDSA` and `SHA512withECDSA`.
- `key_id` (String) An ID for the certificate key pair to be used by the identity provider to sign assertions and responses.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.


<a id="nestedatt--saml_options--cors_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `saml_options.cors_settings`

Required:

- `behavior` (String) A string that specifies the behavior of how Authorization and Authentication APIs interact with CORS requests that reference the application.  Options are `ALLOW_NO_ORIGINS` (rejects all CORS requests), `ALLOW_SPECIFIC_ORIGINS` (rejects all CORS requests except those listed in `origins`).

Optional:

- `origins` (Set of String) A set of strings that represent the origins from which CORS requests to the Authorization and Authentication APIs are allowed.  Each value must be a `http` or `https` URL without a path.  The host may be a domain name (including `localhost`), or an IPv4 address.  Subdomains may use the wildcard (`*`) to match any string.  Must be non-empty when `behavior` is `ALLOW_SPECIFIC_ORIGINS` and must be omitted or empty when `behavior` is `ALLOW_NO_ORIGINS`.  Limited to 20 values.

- `certificate` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the certificate settings used to encrypt SAML assertions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--saml_options--sp_encryption--certificate))

<a id="nestedatt--saml_options--sp_encryption--certificate"></a>
### Nested Schema for `saml_options.sp_encryption.certificate`

Required:

- `id` (String) A string that specifies the unique identifier of the encryption public certificate that has been uploaded to PingOne.

### Nested Schema for `saml_options.sp_verification`

Required:

- `certificate_ids` (Set of String) A list that specifies the certificate IDs used to verify the service provider signature.  Values must be valid PingOne resource IDs.

Optional:

- `authn_request_signed` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the Authn Request signing should be enforced.  Defaults to `false`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_application.example <environment_id>/<application_id>
```
