## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the application in.
- `name` (String) A string that specifies the name of the application.

### Optional

- `access_control_group_options` (Block List, Max: 1) Group access control settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--access_control_group_options))
- `access_control_role_type` (String) A string that specifies the user role required to access the application. Options are `ADMIN_USERS_ONLY`. A user is an admin user if the user has one or more of the following roles Organization Admin, Environment Admin, Identity Data Admin, or Client Application Developer.

If you set the `login_page_url` property for applications in an environment that sets a custom domain, the URL should include the top-level domain and at least one additional domain level. **Warning** To avoid issues with third-party cookies in some browsers, a custom domain must be used, giving your PingOne environment the same parent domain as your authentication application. For more information about custom domains, see Custom domains.

If a value is not provided, the default value is 15552000, or 180 days. Valid values are between 60 and 2147483647. After this property is set, the value cannot be nullified.
