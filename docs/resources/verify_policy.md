  Resource to configure the requirements to verify a user, including the parameters for verification.
  A verify policy defines which of the following one or more checks are performed for a verification transaction and configures the parameters of each check. If a type is optional, then the transaction can be processed with or without the documents for that type. If the documents are provided for that type and the optional type verification fails, it will not cause the entire transaction to fail.
  Verify policies can perform any of the following checks:
  Government identity document - Validate a government-issued identity document, which includes a photograph.Facial comparison - Compare a mobile phone self-image to a reference photograph, such as on a government ID or previously verified photograph.Liveness - Inspect a mobile phone self-image for evidence that the subject is alive and not a representation, such as a photograph or mask.Email - Receive a one-time password (OTP) on an email address and return the OTP to the service.Phone - Receive a one-time password (OTP) on a mobile phone and return the OTP to the service.Voice - Compare a voice recording to a previously submitted reference voice recording.

# pingone_verify_policy (Resource)

Resource to configure the requirements to verify a user, including the parameters for verification.

A verify policy defines which of the following one or more checks are performed for a verification transaction and configures the parameters of each check. If a type is optional, then the transaction can be processed with or without the documents for that type. If the documents are provided for that type and the optional type verification fails, it will not cause the entire transaction to fail.

Verify policies can perform any of the following checks:
- Government identity document - Validate a government-issued identity document, which includes a photograph.
- Facial comparison - Compare a mobile phone self-image to a reference photograph, such as on a government ID or previously verified photograph.
- Liveness - Inspect a mobile phone self-image for evidence that the subject is alive and not a representation, such as a photograph or mask.
- Email - Receive a one-time password (OTP) on an email address and return the OTP to the service.
- Phone - Receive a one-time password (OTP) on a mobile phone and return the OTP to the service.
- Voice - Compare a voice recording to a previously submitted reference voice recording.

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_verify_policy.example <environment_id>/<verify_policy_id>
```
