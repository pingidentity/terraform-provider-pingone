# pingone_rate_limit_configuration (Resource)

Resource to create and manage rate limit configurations in PingOne. Rate limit configurations allow you to exclude specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges from rate limiting.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_rate_limit_configuration" "my_rate_limit_configuration" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  type  = "WHITELIST"
  value = "192.0.2.0/24"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the rate limit configuration in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `value` (String) The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6), or a CIDR range, for the IP address or addresses to be excluded from rate limiting.

### Optional

- `type` (String) The type of rate limit configuration. Currently, the only type supported is `WHITELIST`, indicating that the IP address in `value` is to be excluded from rate limiting.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) A string that specifies the time the resource was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `updated_at` (String) A string that specifies the time the resource was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_rate_limit_configuration.example <environment_id>/<rate_limit_configuration_id>
```
