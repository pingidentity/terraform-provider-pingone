# pingone_mfa_policy (Resource)

Resource to create and manage MFA Policies in a PingOne Environment.

## Example Usage - Basic Policy

The following example enables the Platform Biometrics, Security Key FIDO2 and Authenticator TOTP factors. 

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_mfa_policy" "my_awesome_mfa_policy" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "My awesome MFA policy"

  mobile {
    enabled = false
  }

  totp {
    enabled = true
  }

  security_key {
    enabled = true
  }

  platform {
    enabled = true
  }

  sms {
    enabled = false
  }

  voice {
    enabled = false
  }

  email {
    enabled = false
  }

}
```

## Example Usage - Mobile Authenticator

The following example configures and enables the Mobile Authenticator (using PingOne MFA SDK), Platform Biometrics, Security Key FIDO2 and Authenticator TOTP factors. 

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...

        cache_duration {
          amount = 30
          units  = "HOURS"
        }

        google_play {
          verification_type = "INTERNAL"
          decryption_key    = var.google_play_integrity_api_decryption_key
          verification_key  = var.google_play_integrity_api_verification_key
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "pingone_mfa_application_push_credential" "example_fcm" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_mobile_application.id

  fcm {
    key = var.fcm_key
  }
}

resource "pingone_mfa_application_push_credential" "example_apns" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_mobile_application.id

  apns {
    key               = var.apns_key
    team_id           = var.apns_team_id
    token_signing_key = var.apns_token_signing_key
  }
}

resource "pingone_mfa_policy" "my_awesome_mfa_policy" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "My awesome MFA policy"

  depends_on = [
    pingone_mfa_application_push_credential.example_fcm,
    pingone_mfa_application_push_credential.example_apns,
  ]

  mobile {
    enabled = true

    otp_failure_count = 3

    application {
      id = pingone_application.my_mobile_application.id

      push_enabled = true
      otp_enabled  = true

      device_authorization_enabled            = true
      device_authorization_extra_verification = "restrictive"

      auto_enrollment_enabled = true

      integrity_detection = "restrictive"
    }
  }

  totp {
    enabled = true
  }

  security_key {
    enabled = true
  }

  platform {
    enabled = true
  }

  sms {
    enabled = false
  }

  voice {
    enabled = false
  }

  email {
    enabled = false
  }

}

## Schema

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the sign on policy in.
- `mobile` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Mobile authenticator device policy settings.

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mobile))
- `name` (String) A string that specifies the MFA policy's name.
- `platform` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Platform biometrics authentication policy settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--platform))
- `security_key` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Security key (FIDO2) authentication policy settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--security_key))
- `sms` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) SMS OTP authentication policy settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--sms))
- `totp` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) TOTP authenticator policy settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--totp))
- `voice` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Voice OTP authentication policy settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--voice))

### Optional

- `device_selection` (String) A string that defines the device selection method. Options are `DEFAULT_TO_FIRST` (this is the default setting for new environments), `PROMPT_TO_SELECT` and `ALWAYS_PROMPT_TO_SELECT`. Defaults to `DEFAULT_TO_FIRST`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--email"></a>
### Nested Schema for `email`

Required:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled or disabled in the policy.

Optional:

- `otp_failure_cooldown_duration` (Number) An integer that defines the duration (number of time units) the user is blocked after reaching the maximum number of passcode failures. Note that when using the "onetime authentication" feature, the user is not blocked after the maximum number of failures even if you specified a block duration. Defaults to `0`.
- `otp_failure_cooldown_timeunit` (String) The type of time unit for `otp_failure_cooldown_duration`.  Options are `MINUTES` or `SECONDS`. Defaults to `MINUTES`.
- `otp_failure_count` (Number) An integer that defines the maximum number of times that the OTP entry can fail for a user, before they are blocked. Defaults to `3`.
- `otp_lifetime_duration` (Number) An integer that defines turation (number of time units) that the passcode is valid before it expires. Defaults to `30`.
- `otp_lifetime_timeunit` (String) The type of time unit for `otp_lifetime_duration`.  Options are `MINUTES` or `SECONDS`. Defaults to `MINUTES`.


<a id="nestedblock--mobile"></a>
### Nested Schema for `mobile`

Required:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled or disabled in the policy.

Optional:

<a id="nestedblock--mobile--application"></a>
### Nested Schema for `mobile.application`

Required:

- `id` (String) The mobile application's ID.  Mobile applications are configured with the `pingone_application` resource, as an OIDC `NATIVE` type.
- `otp_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether OTP authentication is enabled or disabled for the policy.
- `push_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether push notification is enabled or disabled for the policy.

Optional:

- `auto_enrollment_enabled` (Boolean) Set to `true` if you want the application to allow Auto Enrollment. Auto Enrollment means that the user can authenticate for the first time from an unpaired device, and the successful authentication will result in the pairing of the device for MFA.
- `device_authorization_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies the enabled or disabled state of automatic MFA for native devices paired with the user, for the specified application.
- `device_authorization_extra_verification` (String) Specifies the level of further verification when `device_authorization_enabled` is true. The PingOne platform performs an extra verification check by sending a "silent" push notification to the customer native application, and receives a confirmation in return.  Extra verification can be one of the following levels: `permissive`: The PingOne platform performs the extra verification check. Upon timeout or failure to get a response from the native app, the MFA step is treated as successfully completed.  `restrictive`: The PingOne platform performs the extra verification check.The PingOne platform performs the extra verification check. Upon timeout or failure to get a response from the native app, the MFA step is treated as failed.
- `integrity_detection` (String) Controls how authentication or registration attempts should proceed if a device integrity check does not receive a response. Set the value to `permissive` if you want to allow the process to continue. Set the value to `restrictive` if you want to block the user in such situations.
- `push_timeout_duration` (Number) An integer that defines the amount of time (in seconds) a user has to respond to a push notification before it expires. Minimum is 40 seconds and maximum is 150 seconds. If this parameter is not provided, the duration is set to 40 seconds. Defaults to `40`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_mfa_policy.example <environment_id>/<mfa_policy_id>
```
