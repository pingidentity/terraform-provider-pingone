# pingone_mfa_policy (Resource)

Resource to create and manage MFA Policies in a PingOne Environment.

## Example Usage - Basic Policy

The following example enables the Platform Biometrics, Security Key FIDO2 and Authenticator TOTP factors. 

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_mfa_policy" "my_awesome_mfa_policy" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "My awesome MFA policy"

  mobile {
    enabled = false
  }

  totp {
    enabled = true
  }

  security_key {
    enabled = true
  }

  platform {
    enabled = true
  }

  sms {
    enabled = false
  }

  voice {
    enabled = false
  }

  email {
    enabled = false
  }

}
```

## Example Usage - Mobile Authenticator

The following example configures and enables the Mobile Authenticator (using PingOne MFA SDK), Platform Biometrics, Security Key FIDO2 and Authenticator TOTP factors. 

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...

          verification_type = "INTERNAL"
          decryption_key    = var.google_play_integrity_api_decryption_key
          verification_key  = var.google_play_integrity_api_verification_key
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "pingone_mfa_application_push_credential" "example_fcm" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_mobile_application.id

  fcm {
    key = var.fcm_key
  }
}

resource "pingone_mfa_application_push_credential" "example_apns" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_mobile_application.id

  apns {
    key               = var.apns_key
    team_id           = var.apns_team_id
    token_signing_key = var.apns_token_signing_key
  }
}

resource "pingone_mfa_policy" "my_awesome_mfa_policy" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "My awesome MFA policy"

  depends_on = [
    pingone_mfa_application_push_credential.example_fcm,
    pingone_mfa_application_push_credential.example_apns,
  ]

  mobile {
    enabled = true

    otp_failure_count = 3

    application {
      id = pingone_application.my_mobile_application.id

      push_enabled = true
      otp_enabled  = true

      device_authorization_enabled            = true
      device_authorization_extra_verification = "restrictive"

      auto_enrollment_enabled = true

      integrity_detection = "restrictive"
    }
  }

  totp {
    enabled = true
  }

  security_key {
    enabled = true
  }

  platform {
    enabled = true
  }

  sms {
    enabled = false
  }

  voice {
    enabled = false
  }

  email {

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--email"></a>
### Nested Schema for `email`

Required:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled or disabled in the policy.

Optional:

- `otp_failure_cooldown_duration` (Number) An integer that defines the duration (number of time units) the user is blocked after reaching the maximum number of passcode failures. Note that when using the "onetime authentication" feature, the user is not blocked after the maximum number of failures even if you specified a block duration.  Defaults to `0`.
- `otp_failure_cooldown_timeunit` (String) The type of time unit for `otp_failure_cooldown_duration`.  Options are `MINUTES`, `SECONDS`.  Defaults to `MINUTES`.

- `otp_lifetime_duration` (Number) An integer that defines duration (number of time units) that the passcode is valid before it expires.  Defaults to `30`.
- `otp_lifetime_timeunit` (String) The type of time unit for `otp_lifetime_duration`.  Options are `MINUTES`, `SECONDS`.  Defaults to `MINUTES`.


<a id="nestedblock--mobile"></a>
### Nested Schema for `mobile`

Required:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled or disabled in the policy.

Optional:

- `application` (Block Set) Settings for a configured Mobile Application. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mobile--application))
- `otp_failure_cooldown_duration` (Number) An integer that defines the duration (number of time units) the user is blocked after reaching the maximum number of passcode failures.  Defaults to `2`.
- `otp_failure_cooldown_timeunit` (String) The type of time unit for `otp_failure_cooldown_duration`.  Options are `MINUTES`, `SECONDS`.  Defaults to `MINUTES`.

<a id="nestedblock--mobile--application"></a>
### Nested Schema for `mobile.application`

Required:

- `id` (String) The mobile application's ID.  Mobile applications are configured with the `pingone_application` resource, as an OIDC `NATIVE` type.
- `otp_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether OTP authentication is enabled or disabled for the policy.
- `push_enabled` (Boolean) Specifies whether push notification is enabled or disabled for the policy.

Optional:

- `auto_enrollment_enabled` (Boolean) Set to `true` if you want the application to allow Auto Enrollment. Auto Enrollment means that the user can authenticate for the first time from an unpaired device, and the successful authentication will result in the pairing of the device for MFA.

- `device_authorization_extra_verification` (String) Specifies the level of further verification when `device_authorization_enabled` is true. The PingOne platform performs an extra verification check by sending a "silent" push notification to the customer native application, and receives a confirmation in return.  Options are `permissive` (the PingOne platform performs the extra verification check. Upon timeout or failure to get a response from the native app, the MFA step is treated as successfully completed), `restrictive` (the PingOne platform performs the extra verification check. Upon timeout or failure to get a response from the native app, the MFA step is treated as failed).
- `integrity_detection` (String) Controls how authentication or registration attempts should proceed if a device integrity check does not receive a response.  Options are `permissive` (if you want to allow the process to continue), `restrictive` (if you want to block the user in such situations).
- `pairing_key_lifetime_duration` (Number) The amount of time an issued pairing key can be used until it expires. Minimum is `1` minute and maximum is `48` hours.  Defaults to `10`.
- `pairing_key_lifetime_timeunit` (String) The time unit for the `pairing_key_lifetime_duration` parameter.  Options are `HOURS`, `MINUTES`.  Defaults to `MINUTES`.
- `push_limit` (Block List) A single block that describes mobile application push limit settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mobile--application--push_limit))

- `push_timeout_timeunit` (String) The time unit for the `push_timeout_duration` parameter. Currently, the only permitted value is `SECONDS`.

<a id="nestedblock--mobile--application--push_limit"></a>
### Nested Schema for `mobile.application.push_limit`

Optional:

- `count` (Number) The number of consecutive push notifications that can be ignored or rejected by a user within a defined period before push notifications are blocked for the application. The minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `50`.  Defaults to `5`.
- `lock_duration_duration` (Number) The length of time that push notifications should be blocked for the application if the defined limit has been reached. The minimum value is `1` minute and the maximum value is `120` minutes.  Defaults to `30`.
- `lock_duration_timeunit` (String) The time unit for the `lock_duration_duration` parameter.  Options are `MINUTES`, `SECONDS`.  Defaults to `MINUTES`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_mfa_policy.example <environment_id>/<mfa_policy_id>
```
