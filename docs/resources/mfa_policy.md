# pingone_mfa_policy (Resource)

Resource to create and manage MFA Policies in a PingOne Environment.

!> The device factor types `security_key` and `platform` are now deprecated, and cannot be configured for environments created after 19th June 2023, nor environments that have been upgraded to use the latest FIDO2 policies.  Existing environments that were created before 19th June 2023 and have not been upgraded can continue to use the `security_key` and `platform` device types, but should look to upgrade the environment's FIDO2 policy support and migrate to the `fido2` device factor type.

~> See [Upgrade MFA Policies for FIDO2 with Passkeys](../guides/upgrade-mfa-policy-for-fido2.md) for the procedure to migrate MFA device policies to the `fido2` device type.

## Example Usage - Basic Policy

The following example enables the FIDO2 and TOTP Authenticator factors. 

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_mfa_policy" "my_awesome_mfa_policy" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "My awesome MFA policy"

  mobile {
    enabled = false
  }

  totp {
    enabled = true
  }

  fido2 {
    enabled = true
  }

  sms {
    enabled = false
  }

  voice {
    enabled = false
  }

  email {
    enabled = false
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Mobile Authenticator

The following example configures and enables the Mobile Authenticator (using PingOne MFA SDK) and Authenticator TOTP factors. 

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

        }
      }
    }
  }
}

  }
}

resource "pingone_mfa_application_push_credential" "example_apns" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_mobile_application.id

  apns {
    key               = var.apns_key
    team_id           = var.apns_team_id
    token_signing_key = var.apns_token_signing_key
  }
}

      push_enabled = true
      otp_enabled  = true

      device_authorization_enabled            = true
      device_authorization_extra_verification = "restrictive"

<a id="nestedblock--email"></a>
### Nested Schema for `email`

Required:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enabled or disabled in the policy.

Optional:

- `otp_failure_cooldown_duration` (Number) An integer that defines the duration (number of time units) the user is blocked after reaching the maximum number of passcode failures. Note that when using the "onetime authentication" feature, the user is not blocked after the maximum number of failures even if you specified a block duration. Defaults to `0`.
- `otp_failure_cooldown_timeunit` (String) The type of time unit for `otp_failure_cooldown_duration`.  Options are `MINUTES` or `SECONDS`. Defaults to `MINUTES`.

- `device_authorization_extra_verification` (String) Specifies the level of further verification when `device_authorization_enabled` is true. The PingOne platform performs an extra verification check by sending a "silent" push notification to the customer native application, and receives a confirmation in return.  Extra verification can be one of the following levels: `permissive`: The PingOne platform performs the extra verification check. Upon timeout or failure to get a response from the native app, the MFA step is treated as successfully completed.  `restrictive`: The PingOne platform performs the extra verification check.The PingOne platform performs the extra verification check. Upon timeout or failure to get a response from the native app, the MFA step is treated as failed.
- `integrity_detection` (String) Controls how authentication or registration attempts should proceed if a device integrity check does not receive a response. Set the value to `permissive` if you want to allow the process to continue. Set the value to `restrictive` if you want to block the user in such situations.

The minimum value is 1 minute and the maximum value is 120 minutes. If this parameter is not provided, the default value is 30 minutes. Defaults to `30`.
- `push_limit_lock_duration_timeunit` (String) The time unit for the `push_limit_lock_duration` parameter.  Options are `MINUTES` or `SECONDS`. Defaults to `MINUTES`.
- `push_limit_time_period_duration` (Number) The time period in which the push notifications are counted towards the defined limit. The minimum value is 1 minute and the maximum value is 120 minutes. If this parameter is not provided, the default value is 10 minutes. Defaults to `10`.
- `push_limit_time_period_timeunit` (String) The time unit for the `push_limit_time_period_duration` parameter.  Options are `MINUTES` or `SECONDS`. Defaults to `MINUTES`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_mfa_policy.example <environment_id>/<mfa_policy_id>
```
