# pingone_notification_template_content (Resource)

Resource to create and manage PingOne notification template contents for push, SMS, email and voice notifications.

~> Only one notification method can be configured per resource, so (for example) a template that requires push, email and SMS will require three `pingone_notification_template_content` resource definitions, one for each method type.

~> The provider will error if custom content has already been configured for a template / locale combination where the variant isn't configured, and template / locale / variant combination where the variant is configured.  Please ensure that before creation with this resource, the desired combinations have their default text restored first.  See [Editing a notification](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_edit_notification) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_notification_template_content" "email" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  template_name  = "strong_authentication"
  locale         = "en"

  email {
    body    = "Please approve this transaction with passcode $${otp}."
    subject = "BX Retail Transaction Request"

    from {
      name    = "BX Retail"
      address = "noreply@bxretail.org"
    }
  }
}

resource "pingone_notification_template_content" "push" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  template_name  = "strong_authentication"
  locale         = "en"

  push {
    body  = "Please approve this transaction."
    title = "BX Retail Transaction Request"
  }
}

resource "pingone_notification_template_content" "sms" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  template_name  = "strong_authentication"
  locale         = "en"

  sms {
    content = "Please approve this transaction with passcode $${otp}."
    sender  = "BX Retail"
  }
}

resource "pingone_notification_template_content" "voice" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  template_name  = "strong_authentication"
  locale         = "en"

  voice {
    content = "Hello <pause1sec> your authentication code is <sayCharValue>$${otp}</sayCharValue><pause1sec><pause1sec><repeatMessage val=2>I repeat <pause1sec>your code is <sayCharValue>$${otp}</sayCharValue></repeatMessage>"
    type    = "Alice"
  }
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_notification_template_content.example <environment_id>/<template_name>/<template_content_id>
```
