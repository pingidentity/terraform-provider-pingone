# pingone_phone_delivery_settings (Resource)

Resource to create and manage SMS/voice delivery settings in a PingOne environment.

## Example Usage - Custom Twilio

```terraform
resource "pingone_phone_delivery_settings" "my_awesome_custom_twilio_provider" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  provider_custom_twilio = {
    auth_token = var.twilio_auth_token
    sid        = var.twilio_sid

    selected_numbers = [
      {
        number = var.my_twilio_number
        type   = "PHONE_NUMBER"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Custom Syniverse

```terraform
resource "pingone_phone_delivery_settings" "my_awesome_custom_syniverse_provider" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  provider_custom_syniverse = {
    auth_token = var.syniverse_auth_token

    selected_numbers = [
      {
        number = var.my_syniverse_number
        type   = "PHONE_NUMBER"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Custom Provider

```terraform
resource "pingone_phone_delivery_settings" "my_awesome_custom_provider" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  provider_custom = {
    name = "My awesome custom notifications provider"

    authentication = {
      method   = "BASIC"
      username = var.custom_provider_username
      password = var.custom_provider_password
    }

    requests = [
      {
        delivery_method = "SMS"
        method          = "GET"
        url             = "https://api.my-sms-gateway.com/send-sms.json?to=$${to}&from=$${from}&message=$${message}"
      },
      {
        delivery_method = "Voice"
        method          = "POST"
        url             = "https://api.my-voice-gateway.com/send-voice"

        headers = {
          "Content-Type" = "application/json"
        }

        body = jsonencode({
          to      = "$${to}"
          from    = "$${from}"
          message = "$${message}"
        })

        after_tag  = "</Say> <Pause length=\"1\"/>"
        before_tag = "<Say>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
