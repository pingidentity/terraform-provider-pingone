# pingone_application_resource_grant (Resource)

Resource to create and manage a resource grant for administrator defined applications or built-in system applications configured in PingOne.

-> Resource grants can be mapped to administrator defined applications that are managed through the `pingone_application` resource, and built-in system applications that are managed through the `pingone_system_application` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_application" "my_awesome_spa" {
  # ...
}

data "pingone_resource" "openid_resource" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name = "openid"
}

data "pingone_resource_scope" "openid_email" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  resource_id    = data.pingone_resource.openid_resource.id

  name = "email"
}

resource "pingone_application_resource_grant" "foo" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_awesome_spa.id

  resource_id = data.pingone_resource.openid_resource.id

  scopes = [
    data.pingone_resource_scope.openid_email.id
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `application_id` (String) The ID of the application to create the resource grant for.  The value for `application_id` may come from the `id` attribute of the `pingone_application` or `pingone_system_application` resources or data sources.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the application resource grant in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `resource_id` (String) The ID of the protected resource associated with this grant.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `scopes` (Set of String) A list of IDs of the scopes associated with this grant.  When using the "openid" resource, the "openid" scope should not be included.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_application_resource_grant.example <environment_id>/<application_id>/<grant_id>
```
