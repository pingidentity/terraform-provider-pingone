# pingone_application_resource_grant (Resource)

Resource to create and manage a resource grant for administrator defined applications or built-in system applications configured in PingOne.

-> Resource grants can be mapped to administrator defined applications that are managed through the `pingone_application` resource, and built-in system applications that are managed through the `pingone_system_application` resource.

## Example Usage - Standard Resources

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_application" "my_awesome_spa" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_application_resource_grant" "my_awesome_spa_standard_resource_grants" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_awesome_spa.id

  resource_name = "openid"

  scope_names = [
    "email",
    "profile",
  ]
}

resource "pingone_application_resource_grant" "my_awesome_spa_pingone_api_resource_grants" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_awesome_spa.id

  resource_name = "PingOne API"

  scope_names = [
    "p1:read:user",
    "p1:update:user",
    "p1:read:sessions",
    "p1:delete:sessions",
    "p1:create:device",
    "p1:read:device",
    "p1:update:device",
    "p1:delete:device",
    "p1:read:userPassword",
    "p1:reset:userPassword",
    "p1:validate:userPassword",
  ]
}
```

## Example Usage - Custom Resource

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_application" "my_awesome_spa" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_resource" "my_custom_resource" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name = "My custom resource"
}

resource "pingone_resource_scope" "my_custom_resource_scope" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  resource_id    = pingone_resource.my_custom_resource.id

  name = "example_scope"
}

resource "pingone_application_resource_grant" "my_awesome_spa_custom_resource_grants" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  application_id = pingone_application.my_awesome_spa.id

  resource_name = pingone_resource.my_custom_resource.name

  scope_names = [
    pingone_resource_scope.my_custom_resource_scope.name,
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `application_id` (String) The ID of the application to create the resource grant for.  The value for `application_id` may come from the `id` attribute of the `pingone_application` or `pingone_system_application` resources or data sources.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to create the application resource grant in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Optional

- `resource_id` (String, Deprecated) **Deprecation Notice**: This parameter is deprecated and will be made read-only in a future release.  This attribute should be replaced with the `resource_name` parameter instead.  The ID of the resource to assign the resource attribute to.  At least one of the following must be defined: `resource_id`, `resource_name`.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `resource_name` (String) The name of the resource to assign to the application.  The built-in OpenID Connect resource name is `openid` and the built-in PingOne API resource anem is `PingOne API`.  At least one of the following must be defined: `resource_id`, `resource_name`.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `scope_names` (Set of String) A list of scopes by name that should be associated with this grant.  For example, `profile`, `email` etc.  When using the `openid` resource, the `openid` scope should not be included.  At least one of the following must be defined: `scopes`, `scope_names`.
- `scopes` (Set of String, Deprecated) **Deprecation Notice**: This parameter is deprecated and will be made read-only in a future release.  This attribute should be replaced with the `scope_names` parameter instead.  A list of IDs of the scopes associated with this grant.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_application_resource_grant.example <environment_id>/<application_id>/<grant_id>
```
