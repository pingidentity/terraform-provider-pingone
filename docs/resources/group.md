# pingone_group (Resource)

Resource to create and manage PingOne groups.

~> This resource carries data and if destroyed, could result in data loss.  Please use the `lifecycle.prevent_destroy` meta-argument ([documentation link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy)) to prevent accidental data loss.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_group" "my_awesome_group" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name        = "My awesome group"
  description = "My new awesome group for people who are awesome"

  custom_data = jsonencode({
    "hello" = "world"
  })

  lifecycle {
    # change the `prevent_destroy` parameter value to `true` to prevent this data carrying resource from being destroyed
    prevent_destroy = false
  }
}
```

- `description` (String) A description to apply to the group.
- `external_id` (String) A user defined ID that represents the counterpart group in an external system.
- `population_id` (String) The ID of the population that the group should be assigned to.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `user_filter` (String) A SCIM filter to dynamically assign users to the group.  Examples are found in the [PingOne online documentation](https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/pingone/page/kti1564020489340.html).

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_group.example <environment_id>/<group_id>
```
