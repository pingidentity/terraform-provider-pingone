# pingone_gateway_role_assignment (Resource)

Resource to create and manage PingOne admin role assignments to administrator defined gateways.

## Example Usage - Assign Population Scope

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_population" "my_population" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "My Awesome Population"
}

resource "pingone_gateway" "my_awesome_pingfederate_gateway" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "Advanced Services SSO"
  enabled        = true

  type = "PING_FEDERATE"
}

data "pingone_role" "identity_data_admin" {
  name = "Identity Data Admin"
}

resource "pingone_gateway_role_assignment" "population_identity_data_admin_to_gateway" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  gateway_id     = pingone_gateway.my_awesome_pingfederate_gateway.id
  role_id        = data.pingone_role.identity_data_admin.id

  scope_population_id = pingone_population.my_population.id
}
```

## Example Usage - Assign Environment Scope

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_gateway" "my_awesome_pingfederate_gateway" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "Advanced Services SSO"
  enabled        = true

  type = "PING_FEDERATE"
}

data "pingone_role" "environment_admin" {
  name = "Environment Admin"
}

resource "pingone_gateway_role_assignment" "single_environment_admin_to_application" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  gateway_id     = pingone_gateway.my_awesome_pingfederate_gateway.id
  role_id        = data.pingone_role.environment_admin.id

  scope_environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
}
```

## Example Usage - Assign Organization Scope

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_gateway" "my_awesome_pingfederate_gateway" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  name           = "Advanced Services SSO"
  enabled        = true

  type = "PING_FEDERATE"
}

data "pingone_role" "environment_admin" {
  name = "Environment Admin"
}

resource "pingone_gateway_role_assignment" "organization_environment_admin_to_gateway" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id
  gateway_id     = pingone_gateway.my_awesome_pingfederate_gateway.id
  role_id        = data.pingone_role.environment_admin.id

  scope_organization_id = var.organization_id
}
```

~> When defining a role assignment, one of `scope_environment_id`, `scope_organization_id` or `scope_population_id` must be defined.

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment that contains the gateway to assign the admin role to.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `gateway_id` (String) The ID of an gateway to assign an admin role to.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `role_id` (String) The ID of an admin role to assign to the gateway.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Optional

- `scope_environment_id` (String) Limit the scope of the admin role assignment to the specified environment ID.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  Some roles cannot be scoped to the environment.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.  At least one of the following must be defined: `scope_organization_id`, `scope_environment_id`, `scope_population_id`.
- `scope_organization_id` (String) Limit the scope of the admin role assignment to the specified organization ID.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  Some roles cannot be scoped to the organization.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.  At least one of the following must be defined: `scope_organization_id`, `scope_environment_id`, `scope_population_id`.
- `scope_population_id` (String) Limit the scope of the admin role assignment to the specified population ID.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  Some roles cannot be scoped to the population.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.  At least one of the following must be defined: `scope_organization_id`, `scope_environment_id`, `scope_population_id`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `read_only` (Boolean) A flag to show whether the admin role assignment is read only or can be changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
$ terraform import pingone_gateway_role_assignment.example <environment_id>/<gateway_id>/<role_assignment_id>
```
