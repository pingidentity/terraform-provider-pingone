## Schema

### Required

- `domain_name` (String) A string that specifies the domain name to use, which must be provided and must be unique within an environment (for example, `demo.bxretail.org`).
- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to add the trusted email domain in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

terraform import pingone_trusted_email_domain.example <environment_id>/<trusted_email_domain_id>
```
