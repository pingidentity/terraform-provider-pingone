# pingone_identity_provider (Resource)

Resource to create and manage Identity Providers in a PingOne environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingone_environment" "my_environment" {
  # ...
}

resource "pingone_identity_provider" "facebook" {
  environment_id = pingone_environment.my_environment.id

  name    = "Facebook"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax, where attributes in `<>` brackets are replaced with the relevant ID.  For example, `<environment_id>` should be replaced with the ID of the environment to import from.

```shell
terraform import pingone_identity_provider.example <environment_id>/<identity_provider_id>
```
