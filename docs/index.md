# PingOne Provider

The PingOne provider interacts with the configuration of the PingOne platform via the management API. The provider requires credentials from worker application client before it can be used.

## Getting Started

To get started using the PingOne Terraform provider, first you'll need an active PingOne cloud subscription.  Get instant access with a [PingOne trial account](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/try-ping.html), or read more about Ping Identity at [pingidentity.com](https://www.pingidentity.com)

### Configure PingOne for Terraform access

The following steps describe how to connect Terraform to your PingOne instance:

1. Log in to your PingOne Administration Console.  On registration for a trial, a link will be sent to your provided email address.
2. Open the *Administrators* environment
3. Follow the guide [Create an application connection](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/main/v1/api/#create-an-application-connection) to create a worker application.  Choose an appropriate name (e.g. *PingOne Terraform Provider*)
4. In the resulting application on the *Configuration* tab, expand the *General* section and extract the *Client ID*, *Client Secret* and *Environment ID*.  These are used in the following examples to authenticate the provider to the PingOne organisation.

Authenticating the provider also requires a code that represents the PingOne region.  See the [Schema](#schema) section below for a list of possible values.

## Example Usage

### Authenticate using static credentials

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingone = {
      source  = "pingidentity/pingone"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingone" {
  client_id      = var.client_id
  client_secret  = var.client_secret
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  region         = var.region

  force_delete_production_type = false
}

resource "pingone_environment" "development" {
  # ...
}
```

### Authenticate using environment variables

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingone = {
      source  = "pingidentity/pingone"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingone" {
}

resource "pingone_environment" "development" {
  # ...
}
```

```shell
$ export PINGONE_CLIENT_ID="admin-client-id-value"
$ export PINGONE_CLIENT_SECRET="admin-client-secret-value"
$ export PINGONE_ENVIRONMENT_ID="admin-environment-id-value"
$ export PINGONE_REGION="admin-environment-region-code"
$ terraform plan
```

## Schema

### Required

- `client_id` (String) Client ID for the worker app client.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
- `client_secret` (String) Client secret for the worker app client.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.
- `environment_id` (String) Environment ID for the worker app client.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` environment variable.
- `region` (String) The PingOne region to use.  Options are `AsiaPacific` `Canada` `Europe` and `NorthAmerica`.  Default value can be set with the `PINGONE_REGION` environment variable.

### Optional

- `force_delete_production_type` (Boolean) Choose whether to force-delete any configuration that has a `PRODUCTION` type parameter.  The platform default is that `PRODUCTION` type configuration will not destroy without intervention to protect stored data.  By default this parameter is set to `false` and can be overridden with the `PINGONE_FORCE_DELETE_PRODUCTION_TYPE` environment variable.
