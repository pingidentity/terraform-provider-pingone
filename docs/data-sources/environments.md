## Schema

### Required

- `scim_filter` (String) A SCIM filter to apply to the environment selection.  A SCIM filter offers the greatest flexibility in filtering environments.  SCIM operators can be used in the following ways: `sw` (starts with) supports the `name` attribute; `eq` (equal to) supports the `id`, `organization.id`, `license.id` attributes; `and` (logical AND) can be used to aggregate conditions.  For example, `(name sw "TEST-") AND (license.id eq "${var.license_id}")`

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ids` (List of String) The list of resulting IDs of environments that have been successfully retrieved and filtered.
