# pingone_flow_policies (Data Source)

Datasource to retrieve multiple PingOne DaVinci Flow Policies.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingone_flow_policies" "by_scim_filter" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  scim_filter = "(trigger.type eq \"AUTHENTICATION\")"
}

data "pingone_flow_policies" "by_data_filter" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  data_filters = [
    {
      name   = "trigger.type"
      values = ["AUTHENTICATION"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to filter DaVinci flow policies from.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Optional

- `data_filters` (Attributes List) Individual data filters to apply to the DaVinci flow policy selection.  Allowed attributes to filter: `trigger.type`.  Exactly one of the following must be defined: `scim_filter`, `data_filters`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data_filters))
- `scim_filter` (String) A SCIM filter to apply to the DaVinci flow policy selection.  A SCIM filter offers the greatest flexibility in filtering DaVinci flow policies.  The SCIM filter can use the following attributes: `trigger.type`.  Exactly one of the following must be defined: `scim_filter`, `data_filters`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ids` (List of String) The list of resulting IDs of DaVinci flow policies that have been successfully retrieved and filtered.

### Nested Schema for `data_filters`

Required:

- `name` (String) The attribute name to filter on.  Must be one of the following values: `trigger.type`.
- `values` (List of String) The possible values (case sensitive) of the attribute defined in the `name` parameter to filter.
