# pingone_user (Data Source)

Data source to read a single PingOne user's data in an environment for a given username, email address or user ID.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingone_user" "example_by_username" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  username = "user123"
}

data "pingone_user" "example_by_email" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  email = "user123@bxretail.org"
}

data "pingone_user" "example_by_id" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  user_id = var.user_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment that the user has been created in.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Optional

- `email` (String) A string that specifies the user's email address. For more information about email address formatting, see section 3.4 of [RFC 2822, Internet Message Format](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html).  At least one of the following must be defined: `user_id`, `username`, `email`.
- `user_id` (String) A string that specifies the ID of the user.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  At least one of the following must be defined: `user_id`, `username`, `email`.
- `username` (String) A string that specifies the user name, which is unique within an environment. The `username` must either be a well-formed email address or a string. The string can contain any letters, numbers, combining characters, math and currency symbols, dingbats and drawing characters, and invisible whitespace.  At least one of the following must be defined: `user_id`, `username`, `email`.

### Read-Only

- `account` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's account information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account))

- `email_verified` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the user's email is verified.
- `enabled` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether the user is enabled. This attribute is set to `true` by default when a user is created.
- `external_id` (String) A string that specifies an identifier for the user resource as defined by the provisioning client. The external id attribute simplifies the correlation of the user in PingOne with the user's account in another system of record. The platform does not use this attribute directly in any way, but it is used by Ping Identity's Data Sync product.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `identity_provider` (Attributes) A single object that specifies the user's identity provider information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--identity_provider))
- `locale` (String) A string that specifies the user's default location as a valid language tag as defined in [RFC 5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html). The following are example tags: `fr`, `en-US`, `es-419`, `az-Arab`, `man-Nkoo-GN`. This is used for purposes of localizing such items as currency, date time format, or numerical representations.
- `mfa_enabled` (Boolean) A boolean that specifies whether multi-factor authentication is enabled. This attribute is set to `false` by default when the user is created.
- `mobile_phone` (String) A string that specifies the user's native phone number. This might also match the `primary_phone` attribute.

- `population_id` (String) A PingOne resource identifier of the population resource associated with the user.
- `preferred_language` (String) A string that specifies the user's preferred written or spoken languages, as a valid language range that is the same as the HTTP `Accept-Language` header field (not including `Accept-Language:` prefix) and is specified in [Section 5.3.5 of RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5). For example: `en-US`, `en-gb;q=0.8`, `en;q=0.7`.
- `primary_phone` (String) A string that specifies the user's primary phone number. This might also match the `mobile_phone` attribute.
- `status` (String, Deprecated) **Deprecation notice**: This attribute is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the `enabled` attribute instead.  The enabled status of the user.  Options are `DISABLED`, `ENABLED`.
- `timezone` (String) A string that specifies the user's time zone, conforming with the IANA Time Zone database format [RFC 6557](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6557.html), also known as the "Olson" time zone database format [Olson-TZ](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).
