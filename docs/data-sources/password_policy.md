# pingone_password_policy (Data Source)

Datasource to read PingOne password policy data

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingone_password_policy" "example_by_name" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  name = "Standard"
}

data "pingone_password_policy" "example_by_id" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  password_policy_id = var.password_policy_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment.

### Optional

- `name` (String) The name of the password policy.
- `password_policy_id` (String) The ID of the password policy.

### Read-Only

- `account_lockout` (List of Object) Settings to control the user's lockout on unsuccessful authentication attempts. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account_lockout))
- `bypass_policy` (Boolean) Determines whether the password policy for a user will be ignored.
- `description` (String) A description to apply to the password policy.
- `environment_default` (Boolean) Indicates whether this password policy is enforced within the environment. When set to true, all other password policies are set to false. Note: this may cause state management conflicts if more than one password policy is set as default.
- `exclude_commonly_used_passwords` (Boolean) Set this to true to ensure the password is not one of the commonly used passwords.
- `exclude_profile_data` (Boolean) Set this to true to ensure the password is not an exact match for the value of any attribute in the userâ€™s profile, such as name, phone number, or address.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `max_repeated_characters` (Number) The maximum number of repeated characters allowed. This property is not enforced when not present.
- `min_characters` (List of Object) Sets of characters that can be included, and the value is the minimum number of times one of the characters must appear in the password. The only allowed key values are `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`, `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, `0123456789`, and `~!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}\|;:,.<>/?`. This property is not enforced when not present. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--min_characters))
- `min_complexity` (Number) The minimum complexity of the password based on the concept of password haystacks. The value is the number of days required to exhaust the entire search space during a brute force attack. This property is not enforced when not present.
- `min_unique_characters` (Number) The minimum number of unique characters required. This property is not enforced when not present.
- `not_similar_to_current` (Boolean) Set this to true to ensure that the proposed password is not too similar to the user's current password based on the Levenshtein distance algorithm. The value of this parameter is evaluated only for password change actions in which the user enters both the current and the new password. By design, PingOne does not know the user's current password.
- `password_age` (List of Object) Settings to control the user's password age. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--password_age))
- `password_history` (List of Object) Settings to control the users password history. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--password_history))
- `password_length` (List of Object) Settings to control the user's password length. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--password_length))
- `population_count` (Number) The number of populations associated with the password policy.
