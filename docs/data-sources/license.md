## Schema

### Required

- `license_id` (String) A string that specifies the license resource’s unique identifier.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.
- `organization_id` (String) A string that specifies the organization resource’s unique identifier associated with the license.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

This license capability always requires active consent by the customer before it can be enabled, and if consent is given, then it allows the full scope of intelligence features included in PingOne Risk (and PingOne Risk plus MFA).
