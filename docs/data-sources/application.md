# pingone_application (Data Source)

Data source to retrieve a PingOne application in an environment by ID or by name.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingone_application" "example_by_name" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id
  name           = "foo"
}

data "pingone_application" "example_by_id" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

}
```
