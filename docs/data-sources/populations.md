# pingone_populations (Data Source)

Datasource to retrieve multiple PingOne populations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingone_populations" "by_scim_filter" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  scim_filter = "(name eq \"My first population\") OR (name eq \"My second population\")"
}

data "pingone_populations" "by_data_filter" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  data_filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["My first population", "My second population"]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment to filter populations from.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.  This field is immutable and will trigger a replace plan if changed.

### Optional

- `data_filter` (Block List) Individual data filters to apply to the population selection.  Allowed attributes to filter: `id`, `name` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--data_filter))
- `scim_filter` (String) A SCIM filter to apply to the population selection.  A SCIM filter offers the greatest flexibility in filtering populations.  The SCIM filter can use the following attributes: `id`, `name`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ids` (List of String) The list of resulting IDs of populations that have been successfully retrieved and filtered.

<a id="nestedblock--data_filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `data_filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) The attribute name to filter on.  Must be one of the following values: `id`, `name`.
- `values` (List of String) The possible values (case sensitive) of the attribute defined in the `name` parameter to filter.
