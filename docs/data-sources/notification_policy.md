# pingone_notification_policy (Data Source)

Datasource to retrieve a PingOne notification policy in an environment by ID or by name.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingone_notification_policy" "example_by_name" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  name = "My notification policy"
}

data "pingone_notification_policy" "example_by_id" {
  environment_id = var.environment_id

  notification_policy_id = var.notification_policy_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) The ID of the environment that is configured with the notification policy.  Must be a valid PingOne resource ID.
