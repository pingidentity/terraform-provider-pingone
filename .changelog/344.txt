```release-note:enhancement
`resource/pingone_application`: **BREAKING CHANGE** Moved from SafetyNet Attestation API to Google Play Integration API for Android integrity detection (P14C-37640).  Customers wanting to enable Android/Google integrity detection for mobile apps will need to upgrade to the latest provider version as `oidc_options.mobile_app.integrity_detection` now requires the `google_play` block to be defined.
```

```release-note:bug
`resource/pingone_application`: Added a default value to optional `oidc_options.mobile_app.passcode_refresh_seconds` attribute.
```

```release-note:note
`resource/pingone_application`: Expanded the native application documentation example for mobile app use case.
```
