```release-note:bug
resource/pingone_sign_on_policy_action: Fixed bug where the `last_sign_on_older_than_seconds` condition, when set to an MFA Sign on policy action that was then changed in the console lead to a provider crash on next replan.
```

```release-note:bug
resource/pingone_sign_on_policy_action: Added `value_boolean` to the `user_attribute_equals` condition block as the existing `value` property didn't correctly interpret boolean values.
```

```release-note:enhancement
resource/pingone_sign_on_policy_action: Added `last_sign_on_older_than_seconds_mfa` condition that can only be set to an MFA Sign on policy action.
```
