```release-note:bug
`resource/pingone_application_resource_grant`: Fixed broken grants when a resource or scope changes it's ID (scopes and resources are re-created, not triggering a re-creation of the grants)
```

`data-source/pingone_resource_scope`: Existing `resource_id` field made read only.  Use `resource_type` and `custom_resource_id` instead.
```

`data-source/pingone_resource_scope`: New `resource_type` field is a required field, and new `custom_resource_id` field is an optional field.  The combination of these fields ensure the correct resource is selected without encountering issue.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
`resource/pingone_application_resource_grant`: Existing `resource_name` field removed.  Use `resource_type` and `custom_resource_id` instead.
```

```release-note:breaking-change

```

```release-note:breaking-change
`resource/pingone_resource_attribute`: Existing `resource_name` field removed.  Use `resource_type` and `custom_resource_id` instead.
